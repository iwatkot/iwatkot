## Hi there! I'm Stan!

I'm a software engineer with a passion for building things. <<< That's what Copilot suggested, it's kinda True (yep, with a capital T, you know what I mean), but at the same time, it does not describe me best.<br>
Because I'm a software engineer with a passion for making complex things simple. Yep, that's it. I believe that all coders should remember that they're here to make the world a better place, so other people can do something very very hard, but with a simple tool. So we hide billions of lines of code behind a couple of buttons, and somewhere, someone can do something very important. Of course, it's not always a world-saving thing, but it's always a good thing. Even if we're just making a delivery of a pizza faster, automating the generation of maps for some game (know one guy), or building AI tools that save millions of people from starvation.<br>
So, yep, that's what I'm thinking about, how coding skills should be used. And that's what I'm trying to do in my everyday work.<br>
<br>
And now let's make the world a better place together! üåç

### Showcase repositories

- [py3xui](https://github.com/iwatkot/py3xui) - sync and async object-oriented API wrapper for the [3x-ui](https://github.com/MHSanaei/3x-ui) panel. It allows you to interact with the API using friendly and easy-to-use methods along with Pydantic models.
- [maps4fs](https://github.com/iwatkot/maps4fs) - a powerful tool for generating maps for the Farming Simulator games using real-world data. It uses different APIs and sources to obtain DTM (Digital Terrain Model), covering the world and some HQ sources for specific countries to generate in-game terrain, as well as generating 3D meshes. It also uses OpenStreetMap data to generate roads, fields, forests, and other objects. On top of that, it collects the usage statistics using FastAPI, MongoDB, Portainer, and Metabase to store, visualize, and analyze the data. The project offers a Python library, RESTful API, and a GUI version based on Streamlit and packed into a Docker container.
