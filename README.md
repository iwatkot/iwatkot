## Hi there! I'm Stan!

I'm a software engineer with a passion for building things. <<< That's what actually Copilot suggested, it's kinda True (yep, with a capital T, you know what I mean), but at the same time, it does not describe me best.<br>
Because I'm a software engineer with a passion for making complex things simple. Yep, that's it. I believe that all coders should remember that they're here to make the world a better place, so other people can do something very very hard, but with a simple tool. So we hide billions of lines of code behind a couple of buttons and somewhere someone can do something very important. Of course, it's not always a world-saving thing, but it's always a good thing. Even we're just making a delivery of a pizza faster, automating the generation of maps for some game (khm-khm), or building AI tools that save millions of people from starvation.<br>
So, yep, that's what I'm thinking about how coding skills should be used. And that's what I'm trying to do in my everyday work.<br>
<br>
And now let's make the world a better place together! üåçüöÄ
